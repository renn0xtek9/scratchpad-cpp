# Longest substring after replacement
Problem:
- Given an array containing 0s and 1s, if you are allowed to replace no more
  than k 0s with 1s, find the length of the longest contiguous subarray having all 1s.

Example:
- Input: []int{0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1}, k=2
  Output: 6
  Explanation: Have the longest subarray of 1s after replacing 0 at index 5 and 8
